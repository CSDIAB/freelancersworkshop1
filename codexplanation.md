this takes the first item in our html where it reads #averagespan, we need this here to essentially allow us to link JS to html and edit
we console log the average soan that way we can make sure it works - it does
we now do the same thing with span count
we also link the ul tag to html
we have our arrays with prices, ocupations, names. we also have a freelancer array with objects inside it ?? that we are essentially pushing to
Now lets go thru the functions

Line(34) functions to update the count

we have a variable declaring the sum
we then have functionality for the sum
Why is it sum = sum + freelancer.price? I have trouble writing these parts on my own.
